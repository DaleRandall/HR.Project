# HR Management Dashboard

The Excel HR data downloaded was utilized to develop a comprehensive HR dashboard in Power BI, highlighting the number of employees in each age group, pay type, and region. The dashboard also provides insights into the amount of voluntary and involuntary employee terminations, categorized by age group and pay type. Additionally, the dashboard offers a detailed breakdown of the ethnic groups represented in the workforce.

The data was transformed and modeled using Power Query, and visualizations were created using a range of charts, tables, and graphs. The HR dashboard provides HR managers with the ability to quickly identify patterns, trends, and areas of concern, allowing for informed decision-making and strategic planning to optimize human capital management.

Overall, the HR dashboard developed in Power BI offers a comprehensive overview of the HR metrics related to employee demographics, turnover rates, and workforce diversity, providing valuable insights to support effective management of human resources.
